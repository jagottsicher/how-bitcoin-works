### INTRODUCTION

A top view of a table which shows 4 people from above (maybe a round or a poker table?). There is some paper, pencils, some self-made toy money, cooffe mug, toys, mobiles and some signs laying around. maybe there is a little stop-clock as a mobile or screen-in-screen.
Voice from the Off:

> hello and welcome to my first explanatory video in which I will try to explain how Bitcoin works in an easy way so that both you kids and your grandma understand what it is all about.
> My Name is Jens Schendel, and I am a German, so apologize my English. I promise to give my best not to sound like Colonel KLink from Hogan' Heroes or - for you my dear millanials - like any Nazi guy from any of your favorite ego shooter. Since late 2011 I live in Shanghai in China - a beautiful country full of miracles and challanges. I am familiar with computers of nearly any kind since my early youth but in 2013 after birth of my daughter Gwendolin

> I started to be interested in Bitcoin mining at home. I did some experiments with my desktop computer at home, some different kinds of graphic adapters and quickly switched to the at that time newly emerged ASIC which worked on a USB hub connected to a raspberry pi. Later I moved some by far not wife-compatible installation on our balcony. But bitcoin mining at home is a different story and shall be told on some different occasion.

> Today I'll explain Bitcoin's concepts as a whole to you and for that task I got me some help. You saw already my daughter Gwendolin is here

> and so is my son Justus. Gwen is 7 years old now and will turn 8 soon and enter the 3rd grade then, while Justus just turned 5 years old, visits the Kindergarten, and after summer holiday will also become a pre-school kids. I am very proud of both of them and grateful for their help with this video. Last but not least 

Ning puts the arrow paper on the table.

> also my wonderful wife Ning helps out.   

Ning waving.

> Her calm, patient, responsible, supporting, helpful, and caring personality will hopefully contribute to this video. Thanks, my dear, I love you.

### FIAT MONEY - Monetary Systems

Showing table. 

> To really understand Bitcoin as an alternative to already existing monetary systems we have a brief look at so called fiat money. In you country this may differ in detail but generally is should be very similar or at least comparable. In most countries or economically concerted areas there is an entity who grants itself the soveranity to issue money to the population. To keep it simple we call it here the Government. In our example my wife Ning represents the Goverment.

Ning put a sign in front of her showing GOVERNMENT.

> The goverment does whatever goverments do and one of their tasks is to provide a working monetary system. Well, they do what we all wished we could do: The print money and make some cash - literally. But due to the fact that this sounds by far more trivial as it is the goverment delegates that job to some more or less free entity which we will call now the CENTRAL BANK. Please keep in mind that in most countries, nations of conferderations all these goverment-to-state bank-to-private bank-to-economy-to-population relationsships and dependencies are much much more complicated, in some cases identical, in some areas even some kind of "out-sourced", but here in our small video the goverment also takes the role of a central bank.

Ning additionally puts a sign in front of her showing CENTRAL BANK.

> As you see the central bank takes care that the population has enough money. 

Ning paying out 10 banknotes to each kid.

> So the participiants of the economic system have enough money to make the economy go on.

Justus sells a toy car to Gwen. Gwen has now only 5 bucks left.

> the central bank also controls the amount of money in circulation. If there is too much money out there 

Gwen opens hand to Ning, Ning refuses to give money.

> then the money's value is lower and the prices go up. That could lead to inflation. and the government and the central bank always take care to keep the inflation under control because they want the value of the issued money to be as stable as possible. So is the exchange rate with other currencies. Anyway, there must also an incent for people to start something new and offer some new value, product, or service

Gwen showing a paper with a drawing of a wonderfull home and a big question mark, also pointing to some bricks next to her. Ning pays out some money to her.

> to the society. But sometimes this system runs out of control. At some point you a society finds itdelf at some point where inflation is so high 

Justus and Gwen have lots of money. Gwen wants a car (pointing at), but Justus holds one hand open and points to all here money.

> that the continuesly raised prices are overtaking the inflation and in an death-spiral of mututally increasing inflation and prices all the money becomes worthless. Only people who hoard some value of finite amount like gold can save some wealth which is more inflation-proof.

Gwen puts some gold bars in her home and buys the car.

> There are other curcumstands which can become a thread to the system. For example 

Ning puts out three Signs "private bank" out and places money there.

> Private banks could hoard money or

Switch to ne scene.Sshwoing all money at Justus rubbing hands

> companies could hoard money instead of investing into new ideas, reasearch, development or innovations.

Take-aways: 
- fiat money is issued and controlled by a combination of governments and ventral banks, 
- it has a nominal value everybody agrees with, because we all agree to rely on a an underlying dependencies that the issuing entities and their mandated central banks take care about the value and establish a long-term monetary system. 
- the value of a currency is not backed with gold for a long time. 
- The value of US Dollar for example and its purchasing power depends on the believe and faith in the US' monetary system. 

On the Dollar you can read "In God we trust" but it should say "In government and central bank we trust".

### DIGITAL MONEY - a new hope

Showing table with many banks and other institutions on. all have lots of money. Kids have each three houses, but little money only.

> At the End of 2008 the situtation leading to the global financial crisis collapsed. Private banks had given loans to private people for buying houses. The loans were granted in a very risky way even to poor people with low income. The private banks accepted them anyway any packed them in smaller and bigger packages to sell out the liabilities as packages after they asked third party institutions to score the risk of the packages. Ususally that rating was quite high. Probably nobody had a detailed look into the smaller packages, the institutions were payed for good ratings, and they could argue at any time that the loans have been granted for a very stable market for decades, real estate, so the loans are backed with real value: houses.

Geld bei Banken verbrennen lassen. Häuser gehen an Banken (Eigentumsurkunde). Banken wollen verkaufen (FOR SALE). Niemand hat Geld (Geld weg). Häuser verfallen (umschubsen)

> The money was burned. The real estate taken by the banks. They wanted to sell the houses, but nobody had enoguh money to buy. The banks lowered the prices to sell to limit their losses, but too late. Also no loans were given anymore and nobody could afford to buy. Eventually the prices for real estate collapsed and many houses fell prey to decay.

> At that time under a person or group of people started in some forums considerations and discussions about a digital currency which worked similar like cash, was indepentendly from any government issued, and which's participants had no need of any kind of controlling third party when doing any kind of transaction. This group or person gave himself the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto". The identity ist still not known.  
> The digital money needed to be imutable - nobody should be able to take control over somebody else's transaction, stop, block, delay, delete or reverse any valid transaction.
> It needed to be trustless. So in any transaction any kind of from both parties trusted third party had to be eliminated. 
> All participents need consensus about the actual state of any issued value
