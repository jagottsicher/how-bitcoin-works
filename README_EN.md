### INTRODUCTION

A top view of a table which shows 4 people from above (maybe a round or a poker table?). There is some paper, pencils, some self-made toy money, cooffe mug, toys, mobiles and some signs laying around. maybe there is a little stop-clock as a mobile or screen-in-screen.
Voice from the Off:

> hello and welcome to my first explanatory video in which I will try to explain how Bitcoin works in an easy way so that both you kids and your grandma understand what it is all about.
> My Name is Jens Schendel, and I am a German, so apologize my English. I promise to give my best not to sound like Colonel KLink from Hogan' Heroes or - for you my dear millanials - like any Nazi guy from any of your favorite ego shooter. Since late 2011 I live in Shanghai in China - a beautiful country full of miracles and challanges. I am familiar with computers of nearly any kind since my early youth but in 2013 after birth of my daughter Gwendolin

> I started to be interested in Bitcoin mining at home. I did some experiments with my desktop computer at home, some different kinds of graphic adapters and quickly switched to the at that time newly emerged ASIC which worked on a USB hub connected to a raspberry pi. Later I moved some by far not wife-compatible installation on our balcony. But bitcoin mining at home is a different story and shall be told on some different occasion.

> Today I'll explain Bitcoin's concepts as a whole to you and for that task I got me some help. You saw already my daughter Gwendolin is here

> and so is my son Justus. Gwen is 7 years old now and will turn 8 soon and enter the 3rd grade then, while Justus just turned 5 years old, visits the Kindergarten, and after summer holiday will also become a pre-school kids. I am very proud of both of them and grateful for their help with this video. Last but not least 

Ning puts the arrow paper on the table.

> also my wonderful wife Ning helps out.   

Ning waving.

> Her calm, patient, responsible, supporting, helpful, and caring personality will hopefully contribute to this video. Thanks, my dear, I love you.

### FIAT MONEY - Monetary Systems

Showing table. 

> To really understand Bitcoin as an alternative to already existing monetary systems we have a brief look at fiat money. In you contry this may differ in detail, but generally is should be very similar or at least comparable.
