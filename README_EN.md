### INTRODUCTION

A top view of a table which shows 4 people from above (maybe a round or a poker table?). There is some paper, pencils, some self-made toy money, cooffe mug, toys, mobiles and some signs laying around. maybe there is a little stop-clock as a mobile or screen-in-screen.
Voice from the Off:

> hello and welcome to my first explanatory video in which I will try to explain how Bitcoin works in an easy way so that both you kids and your grandma understand what it is all about.
> My Name is Jens Schendel, and I am a German, so apologize my English. I promise to give my best not to sound like Colonel KLink from Hogan' Heroes or - for you my dear millanials - like any Nazi guy from any of your favorite ego shooter. Since late 2011 I live in Shanghai in China - a beautiful country full of miracles and challanges. I am familiar with computers of nearly any kind since my early youth but in 2013 after birth of my daughter Gwendolin

Screen-in-screen: Pic of Gwen with a paper on the table showing a curly pointing arrow to Gwen. Gwen waving.

> I started to be interested in Bitcoin mining at home. I did some experiments with my desktop computer at home, some different kinds of graphic adapters and quickly switched to the at that time newly emerged ASIC which worked on a USB hub connected to a raspberry pi. Later I moved some by far not wife-compatible installation on our balcony. But bitcoin mining at home is a different story and shall be told on some different occasion.

> Today I'll explain Bitcoin's concepts as a whole to you and for that task I got me some help. You saw already my daughter Gwendolin is here

> and so is my son Justus. Gwen is 7 years old now and will turn 8 soon and enter the 3rd grade then, while Justus just turned 5 years old, visits the Kindergarten, and after summer holiday will also become a pre-school kids. I am very proud of both of them and grateful for their help with this video. Last but not least 

Ning puts the arrow paper on the table.

> also my wonderful wife Ning helps out.   

Ning waving.

> Her calm, patient, responsible, supporting, helpful, and caring personality will hopefully contribute to this video. Thanks, my dear, I love you.

### FIAT MONEY - Monetary Systems

Showing table. 

> To really understand Bitcoin as an alternative to already existing monetary systems we have a brief look at so called fiat money. In you country this may differ in detail but generally is should be very similar or at least comparable. In most countries or economically concerted areas there is an entity who grants itself the soveranity to issue money to the population. To keep it simple we call it here the Government. In our example my wife Ning represents the Goverment.

Ning put a sign in front of her showing GOVERNMENT.

> The goverment does whatever goverments do and one of their tasks is to provide a working monetary system. Well, they do what we all wished we could do: The print money and make some cash - literally. But due to the fact that this sounds by far more trivial as it is the goverment delegates that job to some more or less free entity which we will call now the CENTRAL BANK. Please keep in mind that in most countries, nations of conferderations all these goverment-to-state bank-to-private bank-to-economy-to-population relationsships and dependencies are much much more complicated, in some cases identical, in some areas even some kind of "out-sourced", but here in our small video the goverment also takes the role of a central bank.

Ning additionally puts a sign in front of her showing CENTRAL BANK.

> As you see the central bank takes care that the population has enough money. 

Ning paying out 10 banknotes to each kid.

> So the participiants of the economic system have enough money to make the economy go on.

Justus sells a toy car to Gwen. Gwen has now only 5 bucks left.

> the central bank also controls the amount of money in circulation. If there is too much money out there 

Gwen opens hand to Ning, Ning refuses to give money.

> then the money's value is lower and the prices go up. That could lead to inflation. and the government and the central bank always take care to keep the inflation under control because they want the value of the issued money to be as stable as possible. So is the exchange rate with other currencies. Anyway, there must also an incent for people to start something new and offer some new value, product, or service

Gwen showing a paper with a drawing of a wonderfull home and a big question mark, also pointing to some bricks next to her. Ning pays out some money to her.

> to the society. But sometimes this system runs out of control. At some point you a society finds itdelf at some point where inflation is so high 

Justus and Gwen have lots of money. Gwen wants a car (pointing at), but Justus holds one hand open and points to all here money.

> that the continuesly raised prices are overtaking the inflation and in an death-spiral of mututally increasing inflation and prices all the money becomes worthless. Only people who hoard some value of finite amount like gold can save some wealth which is more inflation-proof.

Gwen puts some gold bars in her home and buys the car.

> There are other curcumstands which can become a thread to the system. For example 

Ning puts out three Signs "private bank" out and places money there.

> Private banks could hoard money or

Switch to ne scene.Sshwoing all money at Justus rubbing hands

> companies could hoard money instead of investing into new ideas, reasearch, development or innovations.

Take-aways: 
- fiat money is issued and controlled by a combination of governments and ventral banks, 
- it has a nominal value everybody agrees with, because we all agree to rely on a an underlying dependencies that the issuing entities and their mandated central banks take care about the value and establish a long-term monetary system. 
- the value of a currency is not backed with gold for a long time. 
- The value of US Dollar for example and its purchasing power depends on the believe and faith in the US' monetary system. 

On the Dollar you can read "In God we trust" but it should say "In government and central bank we trust".

### DIGITAL MONEY - the double spending problem

Showing table with many banks and other institutions on. all have lots of money. Kids have each three houses, but little money only.

> At the End of 2008 the situtation leading to the global financial crisis collapsed. Private banks had given loans to private people for buying houses. The loans were granted in a very risky way even to poor people with low income. The private banks accepted them anyway any packed them in smaller and bigger packages to sell out the liabilities as packages after they asked third party institutions to score the risk of the packages. Ususally that rating was quite high. Probably nobody had a detailed look into the smaller packages, the institutions were payed for good ratings, and they could argue at any time that the loans have been granted for a very stable market for decades, real estate, so the loans are backed with real value: houses.

Geld bei Banken verbrennen lassen. Häuser gehen an Banken (Eigentumsurkunde). Banken wollen verkaufen (FOR SALE). Niemand hat Geld (Geld weg). Häuser verfallen (umschubsen)

> The money was burned. The real estate taken by the banks. They wanted to sell the houses, but nobody had enoguh money to buy. The banks lowered the prices to sell to limit their losses, but too late. Also no loans were given anymore and nobody could afford to buy. Eventually the prices for real estate collapsed and many houses fell prey to decay.

> At that time under a person or group of people started in some forums considerations and discussions about a digital currency which worked similar like cash, was indepentendly from any government issued, and which's participants had no need of any kind of controlling third party when doing any kind of transaction. This group or person gave himself the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto". The identity ist still not known.  
> The digital money needed to be imutable - nobody should be able to take control over somebody else's transaction, stop, block, delay, delete or reverse any valid transaction.
> - It needed to be trustless. So in any transaction any kind of from both parties trusted third party had to be eliminated. 
> - All participents need consensus about the actual state of any issued value for any participant
> - there schould be a fair and even way for issuing the currency "piece-by-piece" over decades to avoid hoarding
> - the amount of currencies must be limited, to get the currencies not in curculation already must become harder and harder to fight any kind of inflation, better to become completely inflation-proof
> - and of course the new currency must be able to be sent all over the planet digitally without interuption

> So the idea of Bitcon was born as a bank for the bankless to give the resposiblity of the wealth in the hands of the people eliminatiing any third party. For nearly all issues considered where already solutions known. 
> Public key instrastructure for example could serve as a basis for building up mutually trustless transactions and a decantralized public ledger in everybodies hand with a self-organising consensus mechanism became some kind of database without it was needed to trust any kind of maintainer.

> eventually there was only one problem so solve: The double spending problem. To understand it we have a look of our already known monetary system.

Ning Bank with two bank signs in front (top, in the middle), Left Justus, Right Gwen.

> Let's say one wants to send some Cash to someone else. Actually that person initiated a wire transfer to his local bank. That means that his bank puts money on his account and contacts the receivers bank to tell them that he is good for that account. So the receiver's bank accepts that to credit that amount to the receiver's account. From there the receiver can ask the bank to payout the cash to her. 
> The banks trust both their customers and each other. So they take care that the money which is transfered from the sender to the receiver is deleted from the sender's account. A thtird-party is needed to avoid that the sender can spend the "sent" money twice - first send it then take it and spend it.

Same situation, but with elimination the banks. next to Gwen stands an ATM or printer-like machine.

> When eliminating the trusted third party the double spending problem becomes more obvious. Assuming that all other issues have been solved if any kind of value is send over a network you can imagine that like a fax machine. If you don't knwo what that is, imagine it as a copy box or printer connected to the internet which can print cash. 

Justus puts his cash on the machine and scans it. both machines are connected to the internet (a cloud in the middle). A copy appears at Gwen'ss place.

> this is the double spending problem. If you send something over the internet it becomes a copy and that value which it represents is now present at two places. While you do so nobody a few times the value and buying power decreases, nobody can see or follow which spending is the real one and which is a copy, and of course the gate are wide open to inflation.

### DIGITAL MONEY - a new hope

Showing table with participants only. Nobody has any money or Bitcoin.

> Satoshi put all the already known solutions together, stir it, and out came a complete monetary system which even solved the double spending problem. First of all to have Bitcoin is free, so you don't need an allowance or spend money to participate. All you need is a wallet where you can store your Bitcoin in. Here this wallet is represented by a sheet of paper. 

A blank sheet of paper with a bitcoin sign on the top appears in front of Ning, Gwen and Justus.

> Actually nobody has any Bitcoin. A Bitcoin shall be represented by a value which is associated to a number. Imagine this like an address for email or an account number. Each number can exist only one time. But everybody is able to get such a number, better to say to create one or even as many as one wants. And even more precicely it is so that any of such numbers already exists, or? Think about it as a real number of safe-deposit box. The number already exists and the box does but if you start your brandnew wallet you claim an account number - or as much as you want - and to do so you keep a secret in your wallet. 

Everybody writes a secret number and hold the hand over it.

> this we call a private key. It is one of a kind and nobody shall ever know it but you. From this totally super secret private key an account number is deduced from. This is called a public key. Any kind of transaction on the Bitcoin protocol depends on private key infrastructure. As you see, in principal everybody can see everybody's public key. To keep things easy we make this numbers orange now.

Numbers are 1,2 and 3 and they are orange. 

> Please keep in mind this are account numbers, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the value stored on this number and all people participating agree to. If everybody shall agree to, we need to keep track of all other known numbers, but only of one announcing that he has some bitcoin. I hope that makes sense. You don't need to check if someone has no Bitcoin. You need a record in your books and agree only, if there is any Bitcoin assigned to an account. But how anybody got any Bitcoin in the first time then?

> The answer is rather simple. Bitcoin is given out every ten minutes to that participant who claims to have kept record of all known transactions within that ten minutes according to some rules all people running a wallet agreed to. Wow! that sound complicated, but it is not. Have a look.

Showing a clock.

> Every ten minutes there is some bitcoin released. In the beginning that was 50 Bitcoin. To who that Bitcoin is given? To the one who claims it. In our simple example all participants claim the 50 Bitcoin to be their's

The clock becomes smaller and everybody writes 50 (in black) on his or her paper behind their account number. 

> But how is decided who get's the 50 Bitcoin? Easy peasy - The one who solved first a simple mathematical puzzle. The puzzle goes somehow like this: Take your account number, the amount of bitcoin you're claiming to be yours, add all available pending transactions, that involved account numbers, you need an continiously incremented number, a time stamp, and of course the involved Bitcoins and from all that and a special condition called difficulty you build something like a sum of the digits. That's a lot of information which is now so to say boiled down to a single number.

Alle klackern wild  auf Taschenrechnern herum.

> That number is ony of a kind and it is quite hard to get that and in average it takes ten minutes to find one. 
 
Times passes by to 5 Minutes.

> Actually there are no transactions available because nobody owns any Bitcoin. 

Time passes by near ten minutes. Pling of a microwave. Justus has found a number and announces it to the public. (writes that in his book and pushes two identical results in the middle on the cloud). He we wand to use 3 letters to keep things simple.

> The number proofs that the user finished the job. This number is called a Hash. The conditions and algorithm ensures that for any combination of values considered there can only be one hash value. Allthough the number was hard to find it is easy to verify the result. Everybody can see the number. Checking that the number fullfils all critiria represents a proof that conditions the participants agreed to are met. But you are free to accept the result or not.

Both take a number. calculate quickly. 

> Here Gwen agrees, while Ning thinks that she can still find a solution to claim the 50 Bitcoin. 

Gwen writes the same stuff in her account book. under her account she writes Justus account nmumber and +50 and behind the hash value. Ning is still calculating.

> please note that Ning is still calculating. Justus and Gwen already achieved agreement. They reached consensus. The information which they agree on is put into a block of information. 

Both papers are soomed in. We make a rectangle around the information so that Justus' and Gwen's Ledger look the same. Zoom out, Ning still caculation, clock in the seconds ten minutes.

> at this time we'll make it some more complicated. Now Justus wants to send 1 Bitcoin to Gwen to buy a car. What is needed? He needs to write create a transaction for that.

Justus takes another note. The note is zoomed of shown in an animation. all the stuff appears on the paper.

> He wants to reduce his Bitcoin by 1 (his address -1) he wants give 1 Bitcoin to Gwen (her adress and +1 in the next line), also a tiny fee is added as a reward to a "joker" or wildcard, which is not already known (his address -0.0001, * +0.0001). internally his private key is used to sign that announcment which makes it valid and ensures that he has the right to do so. An Transaction number and time is added . This information lands in a pool of unconfirmed transactions where everybody can take a copy out from. This pool of publicy announced but still unconfirmed transactions is called the mempool.

Justus places the number in the cloud in a little space on the cloud called mempool. Justsus and Gwen start calculating.

> As you see everybody is calculating again. The majority of users (Arrow to Justus and Gwen) is working on the second block while a smaller minority is still trying to overtake. But something changed now. There is now more information to be considered to be taken into account. There is now a transaction on the table, which included also a fee. It is not much, but it is an incent for those still thinking they can get a longer chain of blocks. Her it is Ning. She could stick to the plan to find a hash value which gives her the rweard fpr the first block, but firstly she needed to convinvce the majority of people to accept that, but she can guess that she is already so much of behind an already confirmed block that she can not catch up, and secondly she can only aim at the fee and include the transaction in the mempool into her calculations if she accepts the already existing block as valid. 

Ning is shown with question marks and considerations while kids are calculating like crazy. 

> Please note that the longer Ning hesitats the hard the task to catch up will be. She is already lateand even if she found a valid block hash she still needed to find a second valid one which includes the brandnew transaction. So she does the only thing which makes sense and takes the first block as valid, starts calculation also on the second block.

Ning also continues typing.

> Ning also reached consensus. After a few seconds she finds really a solution. Her found hash includes:
> - the hash of block one. 
> - the reward to her address
> - the transaction with all the information included. Justus - 0.0001 = 48.9999, Gwen +1, Ning +50, Ning +0.0001

Writing all the on a paper under her account sheets, adding a recangle and a hash like DEF.

> The procedure to validate blocks with claiming the reward, and confirming transactions is called mining. It is some similar to mining gold and for some years already some users are specialized in aiming at the reward only while the fees are more an extra income. Please note that all 210000 blocks, so approximatly all 4 years, the reward you can get for mining is halved. That means that sometimes around the year 2140 all Bitcoin will be mined and in circulation.

### TAKEAWAYS - what you learned

> Bitcoin is nothing like a digital currency but actually it is used like a digital aquvilent to gold. Bitcoin is different than gold it can be transported over every border. Bitcoin can be seized or forbidden, but as long you are the only one knowing the private key it is impossible to enforce that seizure or prohibition. You can own Bitcoin like any other currency and it is inflation-proof, cannot be taken away, it is not controlled by any government. You can control your wallet, but that comes with a big load of resposibility. You can buy things with bitcoin and you should do whereever possible. As long Bitcoin is hoarded and target of speculators the value will evenutally decay. Start business with bitcoin, make business with bitcoin!

### MORE FACTS - just to read

> so you learned that cormfirming transactions and building blocks and attach one block to the next makes a blockchain with time stamps. The whole procedure is not much more than a database but to be immutable and decenztralized, public and verifiable it is needed to find consensus automatically and with a swarm-like algorithm. The proof of work called procedure is actually the only one which can hardly be tricked or manipulated. You needed to control 51 percent of the world's mining power and even then you could only with extrem effort maybe make some transactions invalid and nebefit from exploting a doubel spending. The costs are too high and you would probably destroy the value and faith in Bitcoin that all your gains would fade away in the wind. 

> the term mining is used because of some similarities with digging for gold. But while digging for gold also is getting harder and harder it confirmes no transactions for people selling or buying aor trading with gold. Betterwas to use the term minting because on top of the fees for confirming transactions you mint new Bitcoin which you directly credit to your own address.

> Probably it was intended that all participants can confirm transactions, and they do, but the rewards are nowadays picked by the big mining pools. It is a useless idea to try to run a mining node with your computer. One factor in the calculations known as difficulty can be seen as a fine-tuning way adjustment to the actually calculation power to ensure the ten minutes rhythm. The difficulty is adjusted all xxx Blocks so approximately all 14 days. 

> Bitcoin is limited to 21 Million, but it can be divided up to 8 decimal places. The smallest unit of 0.00000001 Bitcoin is called one Satoschi. So eventually there will be 2 100 000 000 000 000 Satoshi, of which up to one third are guessed to be lost.

> to those who say that Bitcoin is only a virtual asset and "not real" I say that like a painting Bitcoin is worth what people are willing to pay for it. And also your fiat-money has a nominal value but a any currency is only that worth what people interpret it. 

> don't keep your bitcoin at an exchange! As you don't have the privaty key you don't have control over your Bitcoin. The addresses at exchanges are reserved for you, but they are out of your reach!
